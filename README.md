# A tutorial notebook on 3D image classification

### Dataset

I used a subset of the dataset by [MosMedData: Chest CT Scans with COVID-19 Related Findings](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.20100362v1) which consists of 200 3D CT scans in total for the two classes. 

### Usage

You can run the entire notebook on Colab! Copy the [URL](https://github.com/hasibzunair/3D-image-classification-tutorial/blob/master/3D_image_classification.ipynb) of the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/).

### A tutorial on 3D image classification

I am still working on this. Follow along if you're interested!


### Dataset

[NSCLC-Radiomics-Genomics](https://academictorrents.com/details/95b58ebfc1952780cfe2102dd7290889feefad66) which consists of CT scans with gene expression and relevant clinical data.

### Usage

You can run the entire notebook on Colab! Copy the [URL](https://github.com/hasibzunair/3D-image-classification-tutorial/blob/master/3D_image_classification.ipynb) of the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/).
